      "Data Set Information:\n",
      "\n",
      "Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for \n",
      "attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; \n",
      "attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus \n",
      "the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in \n",
      "the dataset involve the community, such as the percent of the population considered \n",
      "urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita \n",
      "number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units.\n",
      "\n",
      "The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of \n",
      "crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, \n",
      "and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the \n",
      "counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in \n",
      "incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the \n",
      "dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Data is described below based on original values. All numeric data was normalized into \n",
      "the decimal range 0.00-1.00 using an Unsupervised, equal-interval binning method. \n",
      "Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population \n",
      "attribute has a mean value of 0.06 because most communities are small). E.g. An \n",
      "attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) \n",
      "version of that value.\n",
      "\n",
      "The normalization preserves rough ratios of values WITHIN an attribute (e.g. double \n",
      "the value for double the population within the available precision - except for \n",
      "extreme values (all values more than 3 SD above the mean are normalized to 1.00; all \n",
      "values more than 3 SD below the mean are nromalized to 0.00)).\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the normalization does not preserve relationships between values BETWEEN \n",
      "attributes (e.g. it would not be meaningful to compare the value for whitePerCap with \n",
      "the value for blackPerCap for a community)\n",
      "\n",
      "A limitation was that the LEMAS survey was of the police departments with at least 100 \n",
