      "Many variables are included so that algorithms that select or learn weights for \n",
      "attributes could be tested. However, clearly unrelated attributes were not included; \n",
      "attributes were picked if there was any plausible connection to crime (N=122), plus \n",
      "the attribute to be predicted (Per Capita Violent Crimes). The variables included in \n",

      "urban, and the median family income, and involving law enforcement, such as per capita \n",
      "number of police officers, and percent of officers assigned to drug units.\n",
      "\n",
      "The per capita violent crimes variable was calculated using population and the sum of \n",
      "crime variables considered violent crimes in the United States: murder, rape, robbery, \n",
      "and assault. There was apparently some controversy in some states concerning the \n",
      "counting of rapes. These resulted in missing values for rape, which resulted in \n",
      "incorrect values for per capita violent crime. These cities are not included in the \n",
      "dataset. Many of these omitted communities were from the midwestern USA.\n",

      "Attributes retain their distribution and skew (hence for example the population \n",

      "attribute described as 'mean people per household' is actually the normalized (0-1) \n",
